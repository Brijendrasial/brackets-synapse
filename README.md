Synapse is Adobe Brackets extension. it will be provided useful function to you. that can be editing text file on remote server directly. May the code with you :-)

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

While accessing the remote FTP server, it may often contain more than 30,000+ files. This is a limit for out of bounds in Brackets Editor, so you may see the following error:

  <blockquote>This project contains more than 30,000 files. Features that operate across multiple files may be disabled or behave as if the project is empty. Read more about working with large projects.</blockquote>
  
One of the possible/easier workaround was installing File Tree Exclude:
  
Installation file: [**Jon Wolfe's File Tree Exclude**](http://brackets.dnbard.com/extension/jonwolfe.file-tree-exclude)
